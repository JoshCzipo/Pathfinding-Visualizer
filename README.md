# Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer

Gives a visualization of how multiple pathfinding algorithms work, both weighted and unweighted

# Weighted vs Unweighted

By default, every square in the grid has a weight or a "cost" of one. Traveling to each node increases the total cost by its weight value. 
You can press E on a square to increase its weight. Weighted algorithms like Dijkstra's and A* will find the path with the lowest cost. 
However unweighted algorithms like BFS will just find the path with the least amount of traversals.
